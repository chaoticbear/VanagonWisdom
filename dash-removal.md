I pulled the dashboard off. It took about 1 houce since I had done it once before to replace my heater core. The steps were pretty simple.

1. Remove cover to instrument panel.
2. Remove instrument panel (remove 4 screws, speedometer cable, wiring harness, and plugs for switches and warning lights).
3. Remove screws along top of dashboard and on sides by doors.
4. Remove snap off torque bolts holding dashboard to the steering column. These will have to be replaced later with new bolts.
5. Loosen but don't remove bolts holding stearing column to body. This gives the steering wheel clearance to remove the dashboard.
6. Remove the glove box and ash tray.
7. Remove the stereo.
8. Pull the nobs off the heater control levers (4 knobs) and remove the faceplate.
9. Unscrew the heater lever assembly from the dashboard (3 screws).
10. Disconnect the cigarette lighter.
11. Disconnect all ductwork from the vents (2 defrost and 2 fresh air vents). The center defrost vents don't have any ductwork or screws.

Now with the steering wheel losened, give the dashboard a good tug towards the rear of the van and the dashboard will break free of the body. Then just rotate it out and whala!  Here are the after pictures.

This is the dashboard removed and upside down on the seat. Last time I removed the dash I put in sound/heat insulation on the bottom of the dash to try to reduce the noise. That's what the shiny silver mat is on the bottom of the dash.

And finally the bare naked vanagon without the dashboard.

Hmm. Should I pull out the heater core before or after I go to Burningvan 2007? Oh by the way yes you can drive a van in this condition. (Don't forget to re-attach the steering column though.)

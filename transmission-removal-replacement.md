 # Tramsission Removal
This applies to most 80s 2wd vans, other years and 4wd may be similar. 4wd trans also has the front drive linkage and diff lock hardware.

 1. Jack up and place jacks stands for both sides of the rear end. (Don't forget to chaulk front tires.) [See Jack Points] for tips
 1. Break loose nuts/bolts: Engine-Trans nuts, trans mount through bolt.
 1. Disconnect reverse light switch connectors and place out of the way
 1. Disconnect shift linkage. Take note of how it's currently bolted together. (maybe even take a picture)
 1. Disconnect clutch slave cylinder mount bolts. It's possible to do this without removing the hydraulic line, but your mileage may vary
 1. If still connected to hydraulic line, tie slave cylinder up out of the way
 1. Remove starter [See Removing Starter] for tips
 1. Disconnect CV axles from (at least) the transmission side. It's possible to do the removal without completely removing the CV axles but they do get in the way
 1. If CV axles are still attached to stub axles (wheel side) bungee them up out of the way as much as possible. It may be worth removing the CV axles completely, this is up to you, but they get in the way when doing clutch work and cleaning up the flywheel area. 
 1. Detach throttle cable from transmission-throttle cable bracket. Use a screwdriver to pop off the c-clamp, and then pull the cable housing toward the engine through the bracket until the cable itself can slide up through the gap in the bracket. 
 1. Place Trans jack under transmission, jack up to current trans height
 1. Remove Engine-Trans nuts & trans mount through bolt. There are 3 nuts and one bolt on the bell housing, and one through bolt/nut on the trans mount. The top bell houseing bolts are tricky, one is an alan bolt that goes through the starter mount, the other is hidden under the clutch slave cylinder bracket. It's sometimes necessary to remove the transmission mount but can be avoided usually
 1. Remove the Transmission:
     * Be aware of coolant hoses attached or hung up on the hook on the top of the trans.
     * Be sure some support is under the engine itself. 
     * Slightly lower the trans jack to get a feel for how well it's still stuck in there. It's likely going to try to stay attached to the engine studs, while the mount side sinks down slightly
     * Move the trans left to right to start to shimmy the bell housing off the studs. This may turn into more violent shaking
     * A giant screwdriver helps as leverage if you have another person to help pry while shaking the transmission. Alternating between prying and shaking may also help
     
 # Clutch Removal
 1. Remove the pressure plate bolts. This is difficult because the engine will try to turn over when applying torque on the bolts. Here are a couple options.
     * Have a helper with a giant screwdriver lodge the screwdriver between teeth on the flywheel, and wedged against something solid enough for you to turn the bolts.
     * Use another wrench on another bolt to apply opposing torque, so that you can turn the bolts out. The last bolt of course will be tricky but you can usually wedge a wrech in somewhere to block the flywheel while you get that last one out. 
 2. Carefully (be wary of toxic clutch dust) remove the pressure plate. It may come right off, or may require a little prying with a screwdriver. Not a alot, should come right off unless there's some odd damage.
 3. You should now have access the clutch pad, depending on it's state, there may be a lot of detritus and/or toxic clutch powder. Don't breath this stuff in. Be careful while pulling out the clutch not to break it apart and cause even more of a mess. 
 4. Once everything is out, be sure to clean up well, the new clutch needs a clean surface. 
 
 # Transmission Replacement
 1. Jack up transmission, line up the studs with the bell housing
 1. With the trans jack a few inches lower than the transmission mount level, shake and push at the same time toward the engine to get the bell housing to seat on the studs
     * This is never easy
     * Check now and then to be sure nothing has fallen in the way
     * Once studs have enough threading through the bellhousing, get a nut on each stud
 1. Once all studs have a nut, tighten each a few turns to seat them more firmly
 1. Jack up trans to line up with mount
 1. Finish tightening up engine-trans nuts
 1. Attach trans mount through bolt
 
 Other steps from the removal section can happen in reverse order.

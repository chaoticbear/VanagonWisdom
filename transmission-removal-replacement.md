 # Tramsission Removal
This applies to most 80s 2wd vans, other years and 4wd may be similar. 4wd trans also has the front drive linkage and diff lock hardware.

 1. Jack up and place jacks stands for both sides of the rear end. (Don't forget to chaulk front tires.) [See Jack Points] for tips
 1. Break loose nuts/bolts: Engine-Trans nuts, trans mount through bolt.
 1. Disconnect reverse light switch connectors and place out of the way
 1. Disconnect shift linkage. Take note of how it's currently bolted together. (maybe even take a picture)
 1. Disconnect clutch slave cylinder mount bolts. It's possible to do this without removing the hydraulic line, but your mileage may vary
 1. If still connected to hydraulic line, tie slave cylinder up out of the way
 1. Remove starter [See Removing Starter] for tips
 1. Disconnect CV axles from (at least) the transmission side. It's possible to do the removal without completely removing the CV axles but they do get in the way
 1. If CV axles are still attached to stub axles (wheel side) bungee them up out of the way as much as possible
 1. Place Trans jack under transmission, jack up to current tras height
 1. Remove Engine-Trans nuts & trans mount through bolt. It's sometimes necessary to remove the transmission mount but can be avoided usually
 1. Remove the Transmission:
     * Slightly lower the trans jack to get a feel for how well it's still stuck in there. It's likely going to try to stay attached to the engine studs, while the mount side sinks down slightly
     * Move the trans left to right to start to shimmy the bell housing off the studs. This may turn into more violent shaking
     * A giant screwdriver helps as leverage if you have another person to help pry while shaking the transmission. Alternating between prying and shaking may also help
 # Transmission Replacement
 1. Jack up transmission, line up the studs with the bell housing
 1. With the trans jack a few inches lower than the transmission mount level, shake and push at the same time toward the engine to get the bell housing to seat on the studs
     * This is never easy
     * Check now and then to be sure nothing has fallen in the way
     * Once studs have enough threading through the bellhousing, get a nut on each stud
 1. Once all studs have a nut, tighten each a few turns to seat them more firmly
 1. Jack up trans to line up with mount
 1. Finish tightening up engine-trans nuts
 1. Attach trans mount through bolt
 
 Other steps from the removal section can happen in reverse order.
